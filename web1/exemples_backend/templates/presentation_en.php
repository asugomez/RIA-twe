<p>
Set up in Lens in 1992, IG2I is a leading college of engineering turning out chartered engineers specialised in new technologies of information and communication.
</p>

<p>
IG2I is the only public engineering school of Pas de Calais. 70% of our students come from the North and Pas de Calais region. Our aim is to offer our region high standard fully qualified postgraduate engineers that will later be actors of the economic progress of the region. Our training is based on a mix of in-school and in-company periods which enables our students to get a good insight in the corporate world and easily build a professional project.
</p>

<p>
In an area that had to face the closures of various coal pits, IG2I also has a social role by welcoming over 48% of students with government scholarships. Besides, our students are involved in various associations thus showing a strong partnership between excellence and the heart.
